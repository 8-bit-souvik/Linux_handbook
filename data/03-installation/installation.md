1. <span style="color:orange">  Download the Linux distribution of your choice. </span>

 If you're new to Linux, consider trying a lightweight and easy to use distribution, such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint. Linux distributions (known as "distros") are typically available for free to download in ISO format. You can find the ISO for the distribution of your choice at the distribution’s website. This format needs to be burned to a CD or USB stick before you can use it to install Linux. This will create a Live CD or Live USB. 

2. <span style="color:orange"> Boot into the Live CD or Live USB </span> 

Most computers are set to boot into the hard drive first, which means you will need to change some settings to boot from your newly-burned CD or USB. Start by rebooting the computer. 

 - to burn iso in USB/disk we need a software `e.g. rufus`.
    
    (we can do it from android device by downloading any software from playstore)

  - insert USB/disk in computer and set the boot priority to of the USB at first

  - to select boot priority press `F12` key rapidly when company's logo is visible. and select it, then press `Enter`.



3. <span style="color:orange">Try out the Linux distribution before installing </span> 

 Most Live CDs and USBs can launch a "live environment", giving you the ability to test it out before making the switch. You won’t be able to create files, but you can navigate around the interface and decide if it’s right for you.
