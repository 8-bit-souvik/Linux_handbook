## Boot & reboot

In computing, booting is the process of starting a computer. It can be initiated by hardware such as a button press, or by a software command.

In computing, rebooting is the process by which a running computer system is restarted, either intentionally or unintentionally

## Boot Disk 

Alternatively referred to as a startup disk, system disk, master disk, or bootabledisk, a boot disk is a storage device that contains special files required for the computer to boot into an operating system. It can be CD, HDD, USB or any other.
If the bootable disk is removable media (e.g., USB or CD-ROM), it bypasses the hard drive, depending on the settings in the BIOS. This diskette is most often used to troubleshoot the computer or allow the user to copy files when a computer is down.

## Firmwire

Firmware is a software program or set of instructions programmed on a hardware device. It provides the necessary instructions for how the device communicates with the other computer hardware. It is typically stored in the flash ROM of a hardware device. While ROM is "read-only memory," flash ROM can be erased and rewritten because it is actually a type of flash memory.

Every electronic devices `e.g. microwave oven, AC, TV, Washing machine` which have microcontroller must need a software to run it. I case of computer this Firmware is called <b>`BIOS`</b> or <b>`UFEI`</b>. which is stored in a BIOS chip inside it.

<br>

## Boot Loader
A boot loader program is typically started after the computer or the BIOS have finished performing the initial power and hardware device checks and tests.<br> It fetches the <b>`kernel`</b> from the hard disk or any specified boot device within the boot sequence, into the main memory.

An operating system can have single bootloader or multiple boot loader programs classified as primary and secondary boot loaders, where a secondary boot loader might be larger and more capable than the primary boot loader.

<br>

## Kernel

Basically It's a kind of bridge between Hardware and Software.<br>
The kernel is the most important part of the operating system. It is the primary interface between the hardware and the processes of a computer. The kernel connects these two in order to adjust resources as effectively as possible.
